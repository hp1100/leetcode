Introduction:

My name is Huici Pan, 25 years old. I spent 6 years for learning Computer Science in university. 4 years in northeastern University China and 2 years in New York University. After I graduated from New York University in mid of 2018 then I joined in Amazon Seller Payments Report Team. I have worked for this team more than 1 year. So what I am doing now is to make sure all of seller can generate their report well and try to do something to improve their experience.
